PowerShell Visio Automation

No DLL required. pure COM!

Problems have been seen with working with items NOT created via code specifically with Select-visShape


Build on PowerShell V3 with Visio 2013 but should be friendly with V2 and several version lower of Visio.


Currently provides basic functionality as well as some custom functions to present data (for example Attach-visShape, there is a demo file for this)

Note: There is a VERB warning for the use of Attach. I might change the way the functions are named to help them make more sense.
